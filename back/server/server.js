/* server.js
Description: The program that initializes and manages the server that facilitates round management and communication between client instances.
             Uses the express package to host a server on port 5100. The server communicates with clients using sockets.io. Round and Party states
             are managed by dedicated modules.
Inputs: None
Outputs: None
Sources: node.js, sockets.io, and express official documentation

/*
    Includes relevant packages and libraries. 
    - Express: For hosting the server at a port
    - http: For http communication
    - socket.io: For creating communication link between the server and clients
    - body-parser: for parsing incoming requests to the server
    - BattleshipRound: The round manager for battleship gameplay. Controls shot attempts, ship location management, and player groupings.
    - Match, generateUniqueId: The manager for match making and party grouping. Used to generate codes for sharing and linking players across clients.
